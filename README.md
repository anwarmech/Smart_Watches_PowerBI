# Smart_Watches_PowerBI
This project utilizes PowerBI to visualize insights from an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of smartwatch data. 
The dashboard presents interactive visualizations that highlight key trends, patterns, and metrics related to smartwatch usage. 
The goal is to provide clear and actionable insights through dynamic charts and graphs, facilitating better understanding and decision-making based on the smartwatch data. 
The project showcases the ability to transform raw data into meaningful visual representations using PowerBI.
